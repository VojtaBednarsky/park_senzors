## Introduction
This project is meant to realize a parking sensors using ultrasonic module HC-SR04 and micro-controller Atmega328p. Completed version suppose to measure efficiently and precisely distance to the obstacle and give a quick response displaying distance on four seven segment module also depicting it with LEDs and by giving sound. The growing frequence melody is change sounds, which depend on distance. 

Project is written in C, tested with a avr-gcc compiler and loaded through SPI avrdude uploader. 


## Hardware

- Arduino Uno
- Multifunctional shield
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- LCD display 16x2
