## Introduction
This project is meant to realize a parring sensor using ultrasonic module HC-SR04 and micro-controller atmega328p. Completed version suppose to measure efficiently and precisely distance to the obstacle and give a quick response displaying distance on four seven segment module also depicting it with LED s and by giving sound signals. 

Project is written in  C tested with a avr-gcc compiler and loaded through SPI avrdude uploader. 


## Hardware

- Arduino Uno
- Multifunctional shield
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
- LCD display 16x2


## Software

TBD
